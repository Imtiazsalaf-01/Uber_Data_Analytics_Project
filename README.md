# 🚕 Uber Supply–Demand Gap Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the supply–demand gap in Uber ride requests to identify patterns in cancellations, unfulfilled requests, and driver availability issues. The analysis uses Excel, MySQL, and Python-based Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to derive actionable business insights.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Uber often faces a mismatch between ride requests (demand) and driver availability (supply), resulting in ride cancellations and “No Cars Available” scenarios. This project aims to analyze historical Uber request data to identify when and where these gaps occur and propose data-driven solutions.

---

## 🧠 Business Objective
- Identify peak demand periods with low driver availability  
- Analyze cancellation and unfulfilled request patterns  
- Compare supply–demand behavior across City and Airport pickup points  
- Provide actionable recommendations to reduce cancellations and improve ride completion rates  

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
- Excel – Data cleaning, pivot tables, dashboards  
- MySQL – Data querying and aggregation  
- Python – Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook – Exploratory Data Analysis  
- GitHub – Version control and documentation  

---

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains Uber ride request records with the following attributes:
- Request ID  
- Pickup Point (City / Airport)  
- Driver ID  
- Trip Status (Completed / Cancelled / No Cars Available)  
- Request Timestamp  
- Drop Timestamp  

Each row represents a single Uber ride request.

## 🔍 Project Workflow
1. Data understanding and cleaning  
2. Excel-based analysis using pivot tables and charts  
3. SQL-based aggregation and validation  
4. Python EDA with univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis  
5. Insight generation and business recommendations  

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Ride demand peaks during early morning and evening hours  
- Airport pickups experience higher supply shortages than city pickups  
- High cancellation rates occur during peak demand periods  
- “No Cars Available” cases are prominent during night and early morning  

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations
- Introduce time-based and location-based driver incentives  
- Improve airport-specific driver allocation  
- Use historical demand forecasting to position drivers in advance  
- Reduce cancellations through better driver engagement strategies

## ▶️ How to Run the Notebook
1. Clone the repository  
2. Place `Uber_Request_Data.csv` in the same directory as the notebook  
3. Open `Uber_Supply_Demand_Gap_EDA.ipynb`  
4. Run **Kernel → Restart & Run All**

---

## 🏁 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how Excel, SQL, and Python can be combined to analyze real-world business problems. The insights help identify supply–demand gaps and provide data-driven recommendations to improve Uber’s operational efficiency.
